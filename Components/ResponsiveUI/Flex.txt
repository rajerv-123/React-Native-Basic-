Flexbox works the same way in React Native as it does in CSS on the web, with a few exceptions.
The defaults are different, with flexDirection defaulting to column instead of row, alignContent 
defaulting to flex-start instead of stretch, flexShrink defaulting to 0 instead of 1,
the flex parameter only supporting a single number.


Flex Direction
flexDirection controls the direction in which the children of a node are laid out. 
This is also referred to as the main axis. The cross axis is the axis perpendicular to the main axis,
 or the axis which the wrapping lines are laid out in.

column (default value) Align children from top to bottom. If wrapping is enabled, 
then the next line will start to the right of the first item on the top of the container.

row Align children from left to right. If wrapping is enabled, then the next line will start 
under the first item on the left of the container.

column-reverse Align children from bottom to top. If wrapping is enabled, then the next line will 
start to the right of the first item on the bottom of the container.

row-reverse Align children from right to left. If wrapping is enabled, then the next line will 
start under the first item on the right of the container.
