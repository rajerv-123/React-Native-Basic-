Possibly the most common style of navigation in mobile apps is tab-based navigation. 
This can be tabs on the bottom of the screen or on the top below the header (or even instead of a header).

# There are the Type's of tab navigation in native. 


1. createBottomTabNavigator

Material Top Tabs Navigator
A material-design themed tab bar on the top of the screen that lets you switch between different routes by 
tapping the tabs or swiping 
horizontally. Transitions are animated by default. Screen components for each route are mounted immediately.
This wraps react-native-tab-view. If you want to use the tab view without React Navigation integration, 
use the library directly instead.

2. createMaterialBottomTabNavigator

The material-bottom-tabs navigator is moved to react-native-paper. Refer to react-native-paper's 
documentation for API and usage. For any issues with the navigator, please open an issue in 
react-native-paper's repository.
A material-design themed tab bar on the bottom of the screen that lets you switch between
different routes with animation. Routes are lazily initialized - their screen components are not
mounted until they are first focused.
This wraps the BottomNavigation component from react-native-paper. If you configure the Babel plugin, 
it won't include the whole react-native-paper library in your bundle.


3. createMaterialTopTabNavigator-(Material Top Tabs Navigator)
A material-design themed tab bar on the top of the screen that lets you switch between different routes 
by tapping the tabs or swiping horizontally. Transitions are animated by default. 
Screen components for each route are mounted immediately.
This wraps react-native-tab-view. If you want to use the tab view without React Navigation integration, 
use the library directly instead.
